# Workouts App - MERN

This is a simple MERN project for adding the title of a workout, the loads in kgs and the number of repeatations of a workout.
I created a form to add the datas into our database, which is also being displayed on the left side of the app. Inorder to keep the local state and database in sync I used React Context provider and created a global state for the app data.

### My takeaways form the project

Learned how to create a simple restfulAPI and integrate it with monngoDb and React.
Learned the usage of Context and Context provider in React.
Learned how to use Postman for verifying the API requests.
Learned to use the useReducer hook in React.
Used a library called date-fns to format the createdAt date to formatDistanceToNow
